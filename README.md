# Impact-of-5G-Launch-on-WAVECON-s-revenue-and-plan
As part of my virtual internship with AtliQ Technologies through the Codebasics Bootcamp, I got a chance to analyze a dashboard for Wavecon(telecom client) dashboard and provide insights on the impact of the 5G launch. This project allowed me to delve deep into various KPIs and understand the shifts in revenue, user metrics, and plan performance post-5G launch. 

Things that i have accomplished is listed below:

The task is to analyze the dashboard and provide insights on a ppt that addresses the following questions:

What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
Which KPI is underperforming after the 5G launch?
After the 5G launch, which plans are performing well in terms of revenue? Which plans are not performing well?
Is there any plan affected largely by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?
Is there any plan that is discontinued after the 5G launch? What is the reason for it?
